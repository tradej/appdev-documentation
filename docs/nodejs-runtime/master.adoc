== Debugging
This section contains information about debugging your {Node}{ndash}based application and using debug logging in both local and remote deployments.


[#remote-debugging]
=== Remote debugging
To remotely debug an application, you need to start it in a debugging mode and attach a debugger to it.

include::topics/proc_starting-your-application-on-openshift-in-debugging-mode.adoc[leveloffset=+3]

[#debug-logging]
=== Debug logging

Debug logging is a way to add detailed information to the application log when debugging.
This allows you to:

* Keep minimal logging output during normal operation of the application for improved readability and reduced disk space usage.
* View detailed information about the inner workings of the application when resolving issues.
