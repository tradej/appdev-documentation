= Starting and Configuring the {OpenShiftLocal} for the {launcher} Application

This chapter contains instructions for starting the {OpenShiftLocal} and configuring it to execute the {launcher} Application.

NOTE: Starting your {OpenShiftLocal} can trigger a download of large virtual machines or Linux container images. This can take a long time. Subsequent startups are expected to be shorter as long as the virtual machines and Linux container images remain cached.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because a {OpenShiftLocal} is intended for development purposes, it uses HTTPS for the web console and only provides a self-signed certificate. If your browser prevents you from accessing the page due to an SSL error, you must allow your browser to bypass SSL security policies for the {OpenShiftLocal} URL to use it. The screenshot below shows the warning message in the Google Chrome browser.

At this time, Safari on macOS does not work with a {OpenShiftLocal}; this is a link:https://github.com/openshiftio/appdev-planning/issues/16[known issue]. Other browsers, such as Google Chrome, work with a {OpenShiftLocal} on macOS normally.

.Procedure

. Start the {OpenShiftLocal} with the default virtual machine driver:
+
--
NOTE: Depending on your operating system, virtual machine driver, and the number of boosters you run, the memory allocated {OpenShiftLocal} can be insufficient. In this case, increase the memory allocation.

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ minishift start --memory=4096
...
OpenShift server started.

The server is accessible via web console at:
    https://192.168.42.152:8443
----

Alternatively, specify a virtual machine driver other than the default using the `--vm-driver` flag:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ minishift start --memory=4096 --vm-driver=virtualbox
----

Depending on your system configuration, it is possible that you must manually specify an alternative virtual machine driver. You must have virtual machine software, such as link:https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox], installed before you specify it.

NOTE: On macOS, the default virtual machine driver, `xhyve`, can be unreliable. If you experience issues, specifying `VirtualBox` is a reliable alternative.
--

. Open the {OpenShiftLocal} Web console.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ minishift console
----
+
Alternatively, use the URL provided in the log information.

. Log in using the `developer` username and an arbitrary password.

. Optionally, delete the preconfigured project:
.. Next to the project name, click the three-dot menu icon.
.. Select _Delete Project_.
