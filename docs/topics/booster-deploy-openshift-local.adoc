= Deploying the Booster to a {OpenShiftLocal}

. Before you can use a {OpenShiftLocal}, you need to have it installed, configured, and running. You can find more details in link:{link-launcher-openshift-local-install-guide}#installing-a-openshiftlocal[{openshift-local-guide-name}].

. Once you have a {OpenShiftLocal} running, check the console output for the URL you can use to access it.
