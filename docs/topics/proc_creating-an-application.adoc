// This is a parameterized module. Parameters used:
//
//  context: used in anchor IDs to conflicts due to duplicate IDs.
//  parameter-maven-command: This is used to substitute the Maven command appropriate to the runtime being used.
//  parameter-response: The expected response provided by the Java application. Can either be formatted as plain text or a JSON object.
//  parameter-runtime: Ensures that xrefs link to boosters for the appropriate runtime.
//
// Rationale: This procedure is the same for 2 or more runtimes.

= Creating an application

Create a simple `Greeting` application to run on OpenShift using {runtime}.
The following procedure shows you how to:

* Write some simple application code that makes use of functionalities provided by {runtime}.
* Declare dependencies and configure the application build using a `pom.xml` file.
* Start your application on localhost and verify that it works.


[discrete]
== Prerequisites

* Maven installed.
* JDK 8 or later installed.

[discrete]
== Procedure

. Create the application directory and navigate to it.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mkdir myApp
$ cd myApp
----

. Create a `pom.xml` file.
+
ifdef::vert-x[]
[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
include::resources/vert-x/vertx-starter-example-pom.xml[]
----
endif::[]
ifdef::spring-boot[]
[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
include::resources/spring-boot/spring-boot-starter-example-pom.xml[]
----
endif::[]

. Create a new class in `src/main/java/com/example/`.
+
As a recommended practice, ensure that the location of your class within the directory structure of your project reflects the value that you set for `groupId` in your `pom.xml` file.
For example, for `<groupId>my.awesome.project</groupId>`, the location of the class should be `src/main/java/my/awesome/project/`.
+
.Example `src/main/java/com/example/MyApp.java`
+
ifdef::vert-x[]
[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
include::resources/vert-x/vertxGreetingApp.java[]
----
endif::[]
ifdef::spring-boot[]
[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
include::resources/spring-boot/springBootGreetingApp.java[]
----
endif::[]

. Start your application. Execute the following command in the directory containing you application.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
{parameter-maven-command}
----

. Using `curl` or your browser, verify your application is running at `http://localhost:8080`.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080
{parameter-response}
----

.Additional information

* As a recommended practice, you can configure liveness and readiness probes to enable health monitoring for your application when running on OpenShift.
