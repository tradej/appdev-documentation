= Creating and Deploying a Booster Using your {OpenShiftLocal}
You can quickly create, build, and deploy a booster to {OpenShiftLocal} using the {launcher} application. The {launcher} application creates a new repository in your GitHub account containing the booster's code and deploys it to your {OpenShiftLocal}. It can also create a ZIP of the booster for you to download and run on your localhost.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the {launcher} application on your {OpenShiftLocal} using your browser.
** Optionally, use the following command to open the Web Console of your {OpenShiftLocal} in your browser in order to navigate to your {launcher} application:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ minishift console
----

. Select _Launch Your Project_.
. Select _Use {OpenShiftOnline}_.
** Use the _Deploy in OpenShift Online_ option to create a new GitHub repository containing your booster. It will also be launched to {OpenShiftLocal}.
** Use the _Build and Run Locally_ to create a ZIP download containing your booster. This will *not* create a GitHub repository or deploy your booster to {OpenShiftLocal}.

. Follow the instructions to create a booster of your choice.
. Click the _Take a look at your build_ to navigate to your booster in the {OpenShiftLocal} Web console to see your booster's deployment status.
** You can expand your deployment and view the details as it deploys. Your deployment is complete when you see _Build #1 is complete_ under _Builds_ and you see `1 pod` in the blue circle.

. When your deployment is complete, click on the URL at the top of the page to start interacting with your booster. 
** Open the `README.adoc` file in your booster's project for more details about interacting with your booster.
