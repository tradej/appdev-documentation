= Updating Your Booster and Deploying the Changes

To push changes to this booster running in {OpenShiftOnline} or your {OpenShiftLocal}, you can push a new commit to the GitHub repository and start a new build.

.Prerequisites

* Have a booster deployed to xref:deploying-a-booster-to-openshiftonline_{context}[{OpenShiftOnline}] or xref:creating-and-deploying-a-booster-using-your-openshiftlocal_{context}[{OpenShiftLocal}] using the _Deploy in OpenShift Online_ option.

+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/PROJECT-NAME.git
----

. Open your project in your desired IDE or editor, such as xref:using-red-hat-jboss-developer-studio-with-a-booster-project_{context}[JBDS].

$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Made an update"
