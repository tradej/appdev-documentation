= Creating and Deploying a Booster Using {OpenShiftOnline}
You can quickly create, build, and deploy a booster to {OpenShiftOnline} using the {launcher} application. The {launcher} application creates a new repository in your GitHub account containing the booster's code and deploys it to your {OpenShiftOnline} account. It can also create a ZIP of the booster for you to download and run on your localhost.

.Procedure
. Navigate to link:{link-launcher-oso}[{launcher}] using your browser.
. Select _Launch your Project_.
** You may be prompted to log in to your Red Hat Developers account. If you are, click _Log in or register_ and complete the authentication steps.
. Choose your deployment type.
** Use the _Deploy in OpenShift Online_ option to create a new GitHub repository containing your booster. It will also be launched to {OpenShiftOnline}.
** Use the _Build and Run Locally_ to create a ZIP download containing your booster. This will *not* create a GitHub repository or deploy your booster to {OpenShiftOnline}.
. Follow the instructions to create a booster of your choice.
. Open the `README.adoc` file in your booster's project and follow the instructions for building, deploying, and interacting with your booster.
. When you are done interacting with and xref:update-booster[updating] your booster, it is recommended to delete your project. For instructions, see the link:https://docs.openshift.com/online/dev_guide/projects.html#delete-a-project[Deleting a Project^] chapter of the {OpenShiftOnline} documentation. You can redeploy the booster later using the instructions in the relevant xref:oso-create-booster-related-info[runtime guide].

You have link:https://docs.openshift.com/online/dev_guide/compute_resources.html#dev-quotas[quotas^] for your {OpenShiftOnline} account. If you exceed your account quota, you will not be able to launch new boosters using the {launcher} application. The quota for your account varies depending on your subscription.
