= Configuring Your {OpenShiftLocal}

You can use your {OpenShiftLocal} to run your secured booster, but you need to update it from the default configuration.


. Before you can use your {OpenShiftLocal}, you need to have it installed, configured, and running. You can find details on installing a {OpenShiftLocal} for your platform in link:{link-launcher-openshift-local-install-guide}#installing-a-openshiftlocal[{openshift-local-guide-name}].
+
NOTE: You only need to do this once for any of the secured booster missions. They can share the same RH SSO/{OpenShiftLocal} setup.


. Delete the current {OpenShiftLocal} configuration and restart it with a new ISO.
+
IMPORTANT: You must use a different boot iso image than the default in order for RH SSO to startup. If you have already run the `minishift` command with a different memory setting and iso-url value, you need to stop it and completely delete the `~/.minishift` directory before running the following startup sequence.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ minishift delete
$ rm -r ~/.minishift
$ minishift start --memory=6144 --iso-url=centos
----

. Install {launcher} on {OpenShiftLocal} using the link:{link-launcher-openshift-local-install-guide}#creating-launcher-application-using-automated-script[instructions in the {openshift-local-guide-name} guide] making sure to specify `master` for the catalog version.

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]

$ ./deploy_launchpad_mission.sh -p PROJECT_NAME -i developer:developer -g myGithubUser:myGithubToken -v master
