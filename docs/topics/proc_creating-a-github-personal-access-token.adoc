= Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token

To install the {launcher} application on a {OpenShiftLocal}, you must provide the {launcher} application with a GitHub personal access token. This enables the {launcher} application to create booster applications and save them as Git repositories in your GitHub namespace.

.Prerequisites

* A link:http://github.com[GitHub account].

.Procedure
. Using a web browser, navigate to `https://github.com/settings/tokens`.
. Select _Generate new token._
. Add a token description, for example `{launcher} on a {OpenShiftLocal}`.
. Select the check boxes of the following parent scopes and all their children:
** `repo`
** `admin:repo_hook`
. Click  _Generate token_.
. Save the hex code of the personal access token. You need this to complete the installation of the {launcher} application on your {OpenShiftLocal}.
+
IMPORTANT: This hex code only appears once and cannot be retrieved after you leave the page. If you lose the code, you will need to create a new personal access token to install the {launcher} application on a {OpenShiftLocal} again.
