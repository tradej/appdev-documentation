By default, the SSO server is deployed (and destroyed) as part of testing. The steps for executing integration tests are as follows:

. In a terminal application, navigate to the directory with your project.
. Execute the integration tests:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
--
mvn clean verify -Popenshift,openshift-it
--

If you deployed an SSO server beforehand, e.g. by executing `oc create -f service.sso.yaml`, set the system property `skip.sso.init` to `true` when running the tests:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
--
mvn clean verify -Popenshift,openshift-it -Dskip.sso.init=true
--

When executed like this, the tests will use the existing SSO server.
The tests will not deploy their own SSO server, nor will they destroy the existing one.
