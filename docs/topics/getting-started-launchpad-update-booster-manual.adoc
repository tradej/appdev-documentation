= Updating Manually

This approach allows you to deploy updates directly from a local version of the GitHub repository created by {launcher}.

To update your mission manually:

. Clone your project from GitHub.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/PROJECT-NAME.git
----

. Open your project in your desired IDE or editor, such as xref:using-red-hat-jboss-developer-studio-with-a-booster-project_{context}[Developer Studio].

. Perform any updates you want to the project. For example, if you were using the {VertX} HTTP booster, you could update the `src/main/resources/webroot/index.html` to have a different title in the `<h1>` element.
+
.Example update to `index.html`
[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
<div class="container">

    <div>
        <h1>Vert.x HTTP Booster - Updated</h1>
----

. Ensure you are logged in with your `oc` CLI client.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login {link-osl-auth}
  ...follow prompts for username and password; ie. developer/developer

  - or -

$ oc login {link-osl-auth} --token=$MYTOKEN
 ...@see how to obtain your token in note below

$ oc project {project-name}
----
+
NOTE: You can find your token in your {OpenShiftLocal} Web console. For example, if your {link-osl-auth} is `https://{osl-login-url}`, your token would be located at `https://{osl-login-url}/console/command-line`.

. Use maven to start the deployment to your {OpenShiftLocal}.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean fabric8:deploy -Popenshift -DskipTests
----
+
This command uses the Fabric8 Maven Plugin to launch the link:{link-wf-swarm-runtime-guide}#s2i-build-process[S2I process] on your {OpenShiftLocal} and to start the pod.
+
NOTE: A mission's booster may contain tests that assume the build process is running on OpenShift. Since you are building your mission's booster outside of OpenShift before deploying it, you can use `-DskipTests` to skip the testing process. When xref:update-cd[updating using continuous deployment], these tests will not be skipped.

. Navigate back to your {OpenShiftLocal} Web console and ensure your mission's project is selected.

. Click on _Builds_ then _Builds_.
+
A new build will appear in the list and the status will appear.

. After the build is complete, return to the deployed version of your mission's booster application and observe that your changes appear.
