// This is a parameterized module. Parameters used:
//
//  parameter-url: URL to query when interacting with the application
//  parameter-response: Response received from the application
//  context: used in anchor IDs to conflicts due to duplicate IDs
//
// Rationale: This procedure is the same for 2 or more runtimes.

= Deploying an Application to OpenShift

This procedure shows you how to:

* Build your application and deploy it to OpenShift using the Fabric8 Maven Plugin.
* Use the command line to interact with your application running on OpenShift.

[discrete]
== Prerequisites

* The `oc` CLI client installed.
* Maven installed.
* A Maven-based application.

[discrete]
== Procedure

. Log in to your OpenShift instance with the `oc` client.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login ...
----

. Create a new project.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project {project-name}
----

. In a terminal application, navigate to the directory containing your application:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd myApp
----

. Use Maven to start the deployment to OpenShift.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean fabric8:deploy -Popenshift
----
+
This command uses the Fabric8 Maven Plugin to launch the link:{link-s2i-process}[S2I process] on OpenShift and to start the pod.

. Check the status of your booster and ensure your pod is running.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get pods -w
NAME                             READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
{app-name}-1-aaaaa               1/1       Running     0          58s
{app-name}-s2i-1-build           0/1       Completed   0          2m
----
+
The `{app-name}-1-aaaaa` pod should have a status of `Running` once it is fully deployed and started.
Your specific pod name will vary.
The number in the middle will increase with each new build.
The letters at the end are generated when the pod is created.


. Once your booster is deployed and started, determine its route.
+
.Example Route Information
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get routes
NAME                 HOST/PORT                                                     PATH      SERVICES        PORT      TERMINATION
{app-name}         {app-name}-{project-name}.{os-route-hostname}      {app-name}      8080
----
+
The route information of a pod gives you the base URL which you use to access it. In the example above, you would use `\http://{app-name}-{project-name}.{os-route-hostname}` as the base URL to access the application.

. Using `curl` or your browser, verify your application is running in OpenShift.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ curl {parameter-url}
{parameter-response}
