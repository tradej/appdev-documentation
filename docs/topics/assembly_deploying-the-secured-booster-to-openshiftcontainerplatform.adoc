= Deploying the {name-mission-secured} Booster to {OpenShiftContainerPlatform}

:parent-context: {context}
:context: {parent-context}-ocp

In addition to the {OpenShiftLocal}, you can create and deploy the booster on {OpenShiftContainerPlatform} with only minor differences. The most important difference is that you need to create the booster application on {OpenShiftLocal} before you can deploy it with {OpenShiftContainerPlatform}.
