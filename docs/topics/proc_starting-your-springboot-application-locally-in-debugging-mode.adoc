= Starting Your {SpringBoot} Application Locally in Debugging Mode

One of the ways of debugging a Maven-based project is manually launching the application while specifying a debugging port, and subsequently connecting a remote debugger to that port.
This method is applicable at least when launching the application manually using the `mvn spring-boot:run` goal.

== Prerequisites

* A Maven-based application

[discrete]
== Procedure

. In a console, navigate to the directory with your application.
. Launch your application and specify the necessary JVM arguments and the debug port using the following syntax:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.jvmArguments="-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=$PORT_NUMBER"
----
+
`$PORT_NUMBER` is an unused port number of your choice. 
Remember this number for the remote debugger configuration.
+
If you want the JVM to pause and wait for remote debugger connection before it starts the application, change `suspend` to `y`.
