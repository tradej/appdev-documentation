= Continuous Delivery Using {OpenShiftOnline}

After using {launcher} to launch your booster, click the _See it here!_ link under _Creating your project on the OpenShift cloud_ to go to your booster's page in the OpenShift Web console.

To view the build status of your project from the OpenShift Web console:

. Click _View Log_ in the pipeline at the top.
+
NOTE: It can take a few minutes for the link to appear.

. Click _Login with OpenShift_ at the login prompt for Jenkins.
. Click _Login with Red Hat_.
. Ensure all the boxes are checked and click _Allow selected permissions_.
+
Doing this grants the OpenShift Web console the correct permissions and directs you to the Jenkins pod that is deploying your application.

When your deployment is complete, interact with your booster using the URL at the top of the page. For more details about interacting with your booster, see the `README.adoc` file in the booster repository on GitHub.

IMPORTANT: Your booster application is not the same as your Jenkins pod, and it will only appear after the Jenkins pod deploys it. This can take a few minutes.

To push changes to this booster in {OpenShiftOnline}, push a new commit to the GitHub repository:

. Clone your project from GitHub:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/PROJECT-NAME.git
----

. Open your project in your desired IDE or editor, such as xref:using-red-hat-jboss-developer-studio-with-a-booster-project_{context}[JBDS].
. Make an update to the project.
. Save your changes.
. Commit and push your changes back to GitHub:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Made an update"
$ git push
----

. Navigate to the OpenShift Web Console and confirm a new deployment has started.
. Confirm your changes were applied when the deployment is complete.

Continuous delivery with your booster is now configured. It automatically pushes changes in your booster to your {OpenShiftOnline} account.
