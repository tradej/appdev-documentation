= Validating guides

To ensure that all books can be built, validate them using the automatic script provided in the repository.

== Validating all guides

The validation is performed on DocBook XML files generated from the AsciiDoc sources because it is very dificult to perform validations on AsciiDoc sources.

To perform the validation, execute the `scripts/validate_guides.sh` script:

[source,bash]
----
$ scripts/validate_guides.sh
----

== Excluding books from validation

In case a failed validation is an expected behavior--for example if there is a bug in the XML generation--you can remove the book from validation by adding a file named `.ci-ignore` to the main directory of the book, for example:

[source,bash]
----
$ touch docs/wf-swarm-runtime/.ci-ignore
----

To remove the book from validation permanently, commit this file to Git, for example:

[source,bash]
----
$ git add docs/wf-swarm-runtime/.ci-ignore
$ git commit docs/wf-swarm-runtime/.ci-ignore -m "Removed WildFly Swarm Guide from validation"
----

To re-enable validation of the book, remove the `.ci-ignore` file, for example:

[source,bash]
----
$ rm docs/wf-swarm-runtime/.ci-ignore
----
