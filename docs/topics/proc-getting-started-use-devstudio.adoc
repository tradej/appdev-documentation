== Importing the Code of Your Booster
Importing the source code of your booster creates a project in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio and enables you to start making changes.

== Committing and Pushing Changes to the GitHub Repository with the Booster:
Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio provides tooling for committing and pushing code through `git` directly in the IDE. Alternatively, you can use Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio to make changes and push them with the `git` CLI.
