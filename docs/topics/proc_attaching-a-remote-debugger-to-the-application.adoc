= Attaching a Remote Debugger to the Application

When your application is configured for debugging, attach a remote debugger of your choice to it.
In this guide, link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/developer-studio[Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio] is covered, but the procedure is similar when using other programs.

== Prerequisites

* The application running either locally or on OpenShift, and configured for debugging.
* The port number that your application is listening on for debugging.
* Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio installed on your machine. You can download it from the link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/devstudio/download/[Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio download page].

== Procedure

. Start Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio.
. Create a new debug configuration for your application:
.. Click *Run->Debug Configurations*.
.. In the list of configurations, double-click *Remote Java application.*
This creates a new remote debugging configuration.
.. Enter a suitable name for the configuration in the *Name* field.
.. Enter the path to the directory with your application into the *Project* field. You can use the *Browse...* button for convenience.
.. Set the *Connection Type* field to _Standard (Socket Attach)_ if it is not already.
.. Set the *Port* field to the port number that your application is listening on for debugging.
.. Click *Apply.*
. Start debugging by clicking the *Debug* button in the Debug Configurations window.

To quickly launch your debug configuration after the first time, click *Run->Debug History* and select the configuration from the list.
