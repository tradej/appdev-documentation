This guide covers basic information to get started using {ProductName}.

Linux containers allow you to use different ecosystems, languages, and runtimes at the same time for solving business problems.
Container platforms such as OpenShift manage, secure, and automate the deployment and monitoring of your applications.
This enables you to break your business problems into smaller microservices while letting OpenShift provide a simpler way to deploy, monitor, and maintain microservices.

{ProductName} provides you with cloud-native runtimes and prescribes approaches to developing, building, and deploying applications that use those cloud-native runtimes on OpenShift.
These cloud-native development approaches take advantage of the capabilities provided by OpenShift and enable you to use patterns such as Circuit Breaker, Health Check, and Service Discovery.

This guide takes you through cloud-native development on OpenShift.
It shows you how to create and deploy example cloud-native applications called boosters to OpenShift using {launcher-oso} or the {launcher} tool.
These example applications can serve as the foundation for your actual cloud-native microservices since they can be updated and redeployed using the same deployment process detailed in this guide.
